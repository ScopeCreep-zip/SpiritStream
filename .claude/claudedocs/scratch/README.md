# Scratch Documentation

This directory is for **temporary working documents** created during Claude Code sessions.

## Purpose

- Draft analysis and exploration notes
- Feature planning documents (work in progress)
- Temporary research summaries
- Session-specific notes

## Lifecycle

1. Create scratch docs here during active work
2. When finalized, move to parent `claudedocs/` directory
3. Delete scratch docs that are no longer needed
4. Keep this directory clean between sessions

## Naming Convention

- `analysis-*.md` - Code analysis documents
- `plan-*.md` - Feature or implementation plans
- `notes-*.md` - Session notes
- `draft-*.md` - Draft documentation

## Note

Files in this directory are considered temporary and may be deleted during cleanup.
