Start SpiritStream in development mode:

1. Run `npm run dev` which will:
   - Compile TypeScript
   - Copy resources
   - Launch Electron

This runs the application for testing. The process will stay running until terminated.

Note: If there are compilation errors, they will appear in the output. Review them and suggest fixes.
