# Root-level Cargo configuration for all Rust builds in this workspace
#
# This config applies to builds run from the project root (e.g., via build scripts)
# Individual crates in server/ and apps/desktop/src-tauri/ have their own configs
# that add target-specific settings like static CRT linking.
